# CHESS3D
Elevate your chess game with stunning 3D visuals and smooth animations. Play the timeless game with exciting mechanics like en passant and castling, all within a beautifully crafted and immersive chessboard experience.

# Step-by-Step Development Process

## Step 1: Game Requirements

**Feature Specification**:
3D graphics, realistic animations, special moves (en passant, castling, pawn promotion), and sound effects.
Player VS AI with variable difficulty level.

**Platform Selection**:

*Platforms*: PC, mobile (Android).
*Game engine*: Unity (Unity preferred for ease of use with C#).
*Art Style and Aesthetic*: Tiny Chess Asset (5$ on Unity Store)
*Visual theme*: Fantasy.

User Experience Design:

Outline the user interface, including menus, settings, HUD, and in-game prompts.
Sketch wireframes for the layout and user flow.
Step 2: Design Phase
3D Modeling:

Use tools like Blender or Maya to create chess pieces and board models.
Design different textures for each team, considering material variety (wood, metal, marble).
Animation Planning:

Create movement and capture animations for each piece.
Plan special animations for moves like castling and en passant.
Sound and Music:

Source or create sound effects for piece movement and captures.
Develop background music that complements the gameplay and theme.
UI/UX Design:

Design intuitive menus and HUD elements.
Ensure accessibility features like text scaling and colorblind modes.
Storyboard and Game Flow:

Map out the game flow from start to finish, including tutorials, game modes, and win/loss conditions.
Create a storyboard for player interactions and special moves.
Step 3: Development Setup
Environment Setup:

Install Unity (or chosen game engine) and set up the development environment.
Create a new project and configure basic settings (screen resolution, quality settings).
Version Control:

Set up a version control system (e.g., Git) for collaborative development and code management.
Create a repository and establish a branching strategy for features, testing, and releases.
Project Structure:

Organize the project with folders for scripts, assets, animations, sounds, and prefabs.
Create initial scenes, including a main menu and a gameplay scene with an empty board.
Step 4: Core Mechanics Development
Board and Piece Logic:

Develop a 2D array or grid to represent the chessboard.
Implement a base ChessPiece class with common properties like position, team, and movement.
